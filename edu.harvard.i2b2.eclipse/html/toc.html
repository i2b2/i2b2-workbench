        <h1>i2b2 Workbench Help</h1>
        <p>The i2b2 Workbench is an application that gives users a tool to interact with different
            parts of the i2b2 Hive. The most basic workbench consists of a login view that connects
            to the Project Management (PM) Cell. Additional plug-ins connect to other i2b2 cells
            providing different functions to the user. Refer to plug-in help documents for
            information on each individual plug-in.</p>
